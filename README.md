# Agentic AI

## üìñ What is Agentic AI?
Agentic AI refers to a new wave of AI systems that move beyond simple "question-answer" interactions and instead act with **agency**. Unlike traditional AI models that only respond to prompts, agentic AI can:
- **Plan** tasks across multiple steps  
- **Reason** about goals and constraints  
- **Act** by interacting with tools, APIs, or environments  
- **Learn** and adapt through feedback loops  

In short, agentic AI is about building AI systems that don‚Äôt just *predict* but also *decide and do*.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Behind Agentic AI
Building agentic AI typically combines several technologies and frameworks:

- **Large Language Models (LLMs):** Foundation models (e.g., GPT, LLaMA, Claude) that provide reasoning and natural language capabilities.
- **Agents & Orchestration Frameworks:** Tools like LangChain, LlamaIndex, AutoGen, CrewAI, or custom-built agent loops that give LLMs memory, tools, and decision-making skills.
- **Tool Integration:** Connecting to APIs, databases, web browsers, or external systems for real-world action.
- **Memory & Knowledge Systems:** Vector databases (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate, FAISS) and knowledge graphs for long-term memory and context.
- **Reinforcement & Feedback Loops:** Mechanisms for self-correction, optimization, and autonomous improvement.

## üìÇ Repository Overview
This repository is my **hands-on journey into agentic AI**. It‚Äôs structured around practice, challenges, and demos that I build while learning.

- `hands-on/` ‚Üí Code experiments and step-by-step implementations  
- `challenges/` ‚Üí Problem-solving exercises and coding challenges  
- `demos/` ‚Üí End-to-end working examples of agentic AI in action  

Each folder will contain standalone projects with documentation and notes to make learning and reuse easier.
